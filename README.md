# AFL-Fantasy-Analysis
A collection of my R files that I use to generate AFL Fantasy related statistics and graphs. Most of the output ends up on my Twitter page.

# Background
I've been playing AFL Fantasy since I was old enough to use a computer. Calculating player breakevens for my Dad was an after-school task for me. Now that I'm deep into my university degree and gaining more knowledge, I can find more useful AFL Fantasy statistics. But I much prefer creating charts to show visually the trends present in AFL Fantasy.

# Data collection
Open-source data is a big part of the amateur AFL data analysis community. My data comes from the R package 'fitzRoy', created by James Day. You can learn more about the package here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fitzRoy/index.html.

# Code
My code is written in R. Feel free to use it for your own research - that's the main point of this repository!
